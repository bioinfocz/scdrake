# Cell cycle phase assignment

Assign each cell a score, based on its expression of G2/M and S phase markers.
These marker sets should be anticorrelated in their expression levels, and cells expressing neither are likely not cycling and in G1 phase.
In some cases, cell cycle can be the primary factor determining the cell heterogeneity and effectively masking the differences
between cell subpopulations we want to study.

You can view the assigned cell cycle phases in the [Dimensionality_reduction_plots](#Dimensionality_reduction_plots) section below.

```{r, results = "asis"}
if (!cc_genes_valid) {
  scdrake::catn("**Cell cycle score and phases could not be computed for your dataset.** It is possible that it doesn't have any expressed cell-cycle genes.")

# Normalization

Systematic differences in sequencing coverage between libraries are often observed in single-cell RNA sequencing data.
They typically arise from technical differences in cDNA capture or PCR amplification efficiency across cells,
attributable to the difficulty of achieving consistent library preparation with minimal starting material.
Normalization aims to remove these differences such that they do not interfere with comparisons of the expression
profiles between cells. This ensures that any observed heterogeneity or differential expression within the cell
population are driven by biology and not technical biases.

# Highly variable genes (HVGs) selection

We often use scRNA-seq data in exploratory analyses to characterize heterogeneity across cells.
Procedures like clustering and dimensionality reduction compare cells based on their gene expression profiles,
which involves aggregating per-gene differences into a single (dis)similarity metric between a pair of cells.
The choice of genes to use in this calculation has a major impact on the behavior of the metric and the performance of
downstream methods. We want to select genes that contain useful information about the biology of the system while
removing genes that contain random noise. This aims to preserve interesting biological structure without the variance
that obscures that structure, and to reduce the size of the data to improve computational efficiency of later steps.

# Doublet score assignment

The `scran::doubletCluster()` function identifes clusters with expression profiles lying between two other clusters.
Considering every possible triplet of clusters, the method uses the number of DE genes, the median library size,
and the proporion of cells in the cluster to mark clusters as possible doublets.

if (normalization_type_sce == "scran" && cfg$SCRAN_USE_QUICKCLUSTER) {
  cat("Prior to normalization, quick clustering was performed. We can use those clusters to look at doublet score within them:\n\n")

```{r, results = "asis"}
if (rlang::is_true(sce_metadata$has_filtered_doublets)) {
  n_doublets <- sum(sce_colData$is_doublet)

# Dimensionality reduction

As the name suggests, dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of separate dimensions in the data.
See [this chapter](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.15/OSCA.basic/dimensionality-reduction.html) in OSCA that provides
an intuitive explanation of the motivation behind, along with basic introduction to PCA, t-SNE and UMAP.

## PCA

Principal components analysis (PCA) discovers axes in high-dimensional space that capture the largest amount of variation.
In case of scRNA-seq, we basically compress multiple features into several dimensions.
This reduces computational work in downstream analyses like clustering and other DR methods (UMAP and t-SNE),
as calculations only need to be performed for a few dimensions rather than thousands of genes.
It also reduces noise by averaging across multiple genes to obtain a more precise representation of the patterns in the data.

### PCs selection

By definition, the top PCs capture the dominant factors of heterogeneity in the data set.
In the context of scRNA-seq, our assumption is that biological processes affect multiple genes in a coordinated manner.
This means that the earlier PCs are likely to represent biological structure as more variation can be captured by
considering the correlated behavior of many genes. We use the earlier PCs in our downstream analyses, which concentrates
the biological signal to simultaneously reduce computational work and remove noise.

There are several methods how to select the first PCs:

- Elbow point method: a simple heuristic for choosing PCs involves identifying the elbow point in the percentage of
  variance explained by successive PCs. This refers to the "elbow" in the curve of a scree plot as shown.
- Technical variance method: use the technical component estimates to determine the proportion of variance that should be retained.
  This is implemented in `scran::denoisePCA()`, which takes the estimates returned by `scran::modelGeneVar()`.
- Forced: use a predefined number of PCs.

drake::readd(pca_selected_pcs_plot, path = drake_cache_dir)
```

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))) is a software for running
isolated *containers* which are based on *images*. You can think of them as small, isolated operating systems.

The [Bioconductor's page for Docker](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/) provides itself a nice introduction to
Docker and its usage for R, and we recommend to read it through.
In this vignette, we will mainly give practical examples related to `{scdrake}`.

You can also run the image in [SingularityCE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/quick_start.html) (without RStudio) -
see [Singularity](#singularity) below.

# Platform-specific notes

## Linux hosts (_important_)

On a Linux host, there can be different Docker distributions installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (DD)
  - DD is a more sophisticated suite which runs a Linux virtual machine in which DE is run. DD can be used on Linux hosts,
  but it is required for Mac and Windows ones. However, on Linux, DD has some differences, of which the one that most
  affects `{scdrake}`'s ease of use is file sharing (will be discussed later).
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) (DE).
  - DE is the core of Docker that manages containers. It can be used natively on Linux hosts.

If you are using a Linux host to run the `{scdrake}` image, we **recommend** to stick with Docker Engine
(see the [official FAQ](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/linuxfaqs/) on DD and Linux).

**See [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/linuxfaqs/#context) how to quickly switch to DE if you have installed DD.**

Otherwise in Docker Desktop:

- You won't be able to run RStudio Server due to problems with file ownership.
- To sustain the file ownership in the shared directory, you have to execute commands in the container as root.
  That means you have to omit the `-u rstudio` parameter or use `-u root`. For more details see the note in
  [Problems with filesystem permissions](#problems-with-filesystem-permissions) below.

## Windows

We recommend to use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) and its
[Ubuntu distribution](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview) for Docker Desktop
([guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)) as this is successfully tested by us.

# Cheatsheet

A quick summary of the more detailed steps below. Note that this is not covering a special case of a Linux host
using Docker Desktop.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show the cheatsheet</summary>

## Get the `scdrake` image

### Linux, Windows, and amd64 Mac

Latest stable version:

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_pull_stable)`

Latest development version:

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_pull_latest)`

## Create a shared directory

```bash
mkdir ~/scdrake_projects
cd ~/scdrake_projects
```

## Run the image

For Linux (using Docker Engine), Mac and Windows.

```{r docker_run_rstudio, include = FALSE}
out_docker_run_rstudio <- scdrake::format_shell_command(c(
  "docker run -d",
  "-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects",
  "-p 8787:8787",
  "-e USERID=$(id -u)",
  "-e GROUPID=$(id -g)",
  "-e PASSWORD=1234",
  DOCKER_IMAGE_STABLE
))
```

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_run_rstudio)`

## Find the ID or name of the running container

```bash
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND   CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES

# Obtaining the Docker image

A Docker image based on the [official Bioconductor image](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/)
(version `r BIOC_VERSION`) is available. This is the most handy and reproducible way how to use
`{scdrake}` as all the dependencies are already installed and their version is fixed.
In addition, the parent Bioconductor image comes bundled with RStudio Server.

You can pull the Docker image with the latest stable `{scdrake}` version using

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_pull_stable)`

or list available versions in [our Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/jirinovo/scdrake/tags).

For the latest development version use

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_pull_latest)`

***

# Running the image

The `{scdrake}`'s image is based on the [Bioconductor's image](https://bioconductor.org/help/docker/)
which is in turn based on the [Rocker Project's](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html)
image (`rocker/rstudio`). Thanks to it, the `{scdrake}`'s image comes bundled with RStudio Server.

Docker allows to mount local (host) directories to containers. We recommend to create a local directory in
which individual `{scdrake}` projects (and other files, if needed) will lie. This way you won't lose data when
a container is destroyed. Let's create such shared directory in your home directory and switch to it:

```bash
mkdir ~/scdrake_projects
cd ~/scdrake_projects
```

## Running detached with RStudio Server

**Important**: not working on Linux hosts using Docker Desktop.

[RStudio Server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/) is a comfortable IDE for R.
You can run the image including an RStudio instance using:

`r knitr::knit(text = out_docker_run_rstudio)`

Let's decompose the command above:

- `docker run`: run image as a container.
- `-d`: run in detached ("background") mode.
- `-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects`: mount the current working directory on the host machine as
  `/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects` inside the container.
- `-p 8787:8787`: expose port `8787` in container as port `8787` on localhost.
- `-e USERID=$(id -u) -e GROUPID=$(id -g)`: change ownership of `/home/rstudio` in the container to the ID and group ID
  of the current host user. This is important as it sustains the correct file ownership, i.e. when you write to
  `/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects` from within the container, you actually write to the host filesystem and you do so
  as the proper user/group.
- `-e PASSWORD=1234`: password for RStudio Server (and the username is `rstudio`).
- `jirinovo/scdrake:<tag>`: repository and tag of the image to be run.

The `-e VAR=VALUE` arguments are used to set environment variables inside the container. You can check those for the
parent `rocker/rstudio` image [here](https://rocker-project.org/images/versioned/rstudio.html#environment-variables).

An image can have a default command which is executed on container run. For our image, it's a script `/init` which
starts RStudio Server.

Now you can check that the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see something as

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND   CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                       NAMES
d47b4d265052   scdrake:1.4.0-bioc3.15           "/init"   24 hours ago   Up 24 hours   0.0.0.0:8787->8787/tcp, :::8787->8787/tcp   condescending_payne
```

Values in the `CONTAINER ID` and `NAMES` columns can be then used to reference the running container.

You can see that we have exposed port `8787`. What it is useful for? Well, it allows us to connect to RStudio Server
instance, which is running on port 8787 inside the container. Now you can just open your browser, navigate to
`localhost:8787` and login as `rstudio` with password `1234`.

TIP: if you are using a remote server which you can SSH into and it allows SSH tunneling, then you can forward the
exposed port to your host:

```bash
ssh -NL 8787:localhost:8787 user@server
```

Now you can start using `{scdrake}` from the RStudio, or read below for alternative ways.

## Running detached without RStudio Server

If you just want to run the image detached without RStudio Server, use

```{r docker_run_detached, include = FALSE}
out <- scdrake::format_shell_command(c(
  "docker run -d",
  "-u rstudio",
  "-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects",
  DOCKER_IMAGE_STABLE,
  "sleep infinity"
))
```

`r knitr::knit(text = out)`

Note for Docker Desktop on a Linux host: omit the `-u rstudio` (or use `-u root`) to run the image as root.
This will mount `/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects` as UID 0 in the container, but UID of the DD user will be used in the
host directory.

## Running once ("run and forget")

Running the image in detached mode gives us chance e.g. to find out more details about what's wrong in a failed pipeline
run, or to work interactively in RStudio. However, we can also run the image in a "run and forget" mode where a
container is started, `{scdrake}` is run, and finally the container is stopped and removed.

```{r docker_run_once, include = FALSE}
out <- scdrake::format_shell_command(c(
  "docker run -it --rm",
  "-v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects",
  DOCKER_IMAGE_STABLE,
  "scdrake ..."
))
```

`r knitr::knit(text = out)`

Note for Linux hosts using Docker Engine: the active user in the container will be root and created files will belong
to him. If your user ID (UID) on the host is 1000, you can use the `-u rstudio`, and created files will then belong to you.
If your UID is different, then either run the image including RStudio or refer to
[Problems with filesystem permissions](#problems-with-filesystem-permissions) below.

***

# Issuing commands in the running container

You can start `bash` or `R` process inside the container and attach to it using

```bash
docker exec -it -u rstudio <CONTAINER ID or NAME> bash
docker exec -it -u rstudio <CONTAINER ID or NAME> R
```

- `docker exec`: executes a command in a **running** container.
- `-i`: interactive.
- `-t`: allocate a pseudo-TTY.

Note for Docker Desktop on a Linux host: omit the `-u rstudio` (or use `-u root`).

***

# Problems with filesystem permissions {.tabset}

In the first example, when we run the image including RStudio Server, we specified
`-e USERID=$(id -u) -e GROUPID=$(id -g)`, and so ownership of `/home/rstudio` was changed to match the host user\*.
Then when you write to the shared directory `/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects`, you are basically doing that as the host user.

*<sup>\* This is actually not a feature of Docker, but the `rocker/rstudio` image which uses those environment
variables to run the `/rocker_scripts/init_userconf.sh` which manages the ownership.</sup>*

By default, `rstudio` user in the container has ID of 1000 which is commonly used for the default user in most
Linux distributions. You can check it yourself on your host by executing `id -u`. If it is 1000, then you can safely
skip the instructions below.

Note for Linux hosts using Docker Desktop: in this case, Docker manages the file ownership as described
[here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/linuxfaqs/#how-do-i-enable-file-sharing). For you it means the root user
(UID 0) inside the container will write to the shared directory using UID of the Docker Desktop user, so you don't have
to care about the `-u rstudio` parameter in `docker exec` command.

***

So when you don't want to run RStudio Server and your host user ID is not 1000, you have to take care of ownership
by yourself. There are several ways how to accomplish that. You can also read about this problem
[here](https://www.fullstaq.com/knowledge-hub/blogs/docker-and-the-host-filesystem-owner-matching-problem) or
[here](https://vsupalov.com/docker-shared-permissions/).

## Modify the user and group ID in the container

The `rocker/rstudio` parent image already comes with a script which can add or modify user information
(it is actually run when you start the container including RStudio Server).

```bash
docker exec \
  -e USERID=$(id -u) -e GROUPID=$(id -g) \
  <CONTAINER ID or NAME> \
  bash /rocker_scripts/init_userconf.sh
```

Note that this just changes ID and group of the `rstudio` user, so later don't forget to run commands as this user,
i.e. `docker exec -u rstudio ...`

## "Chowning" (tedious)

If you have root privileges on the host, you can just change ownership each time you write to the shared directory
from the container:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) scdrake_projects
```

***

# Issuing `{scdrake}` commands through its command line interface (CLI)

We now assume that the `{scdrake}` container is running and the shared directory is mounted in
`/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects`. The `{scdrake}` commands can be easily issued through its CLI
(see `vignette("scdrake_cli")`):

```bash
docker exec -it -u rstudio <CONTAINER ID or NAME> \
  scdrake -h
```

The usual workflow can be similar to the following:

1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
docker exec -it -u rstudio -w /home/rstudio/scdrake_projects <CONTAINER ID or NAME> \
  scdrake -d my_first_project init-project
```

2. Modify the configs on your host in `my_first_project/config/`

3. Run the pipeline:

```bash
docker exec -it -u rstudio -w /home/rstudio/scdrake_projects/my_first_project <CONTAINER ID or NAME> \
  scdrake --pipeline-type single_sample run
```

Note for Docker Desktop on a Linux host: omit the `-u rstudio` (or use `-u root`).

***

# Create a command alias

To reduce typing/copy-pasting a bit, you can create a command alias in your shell, here for `bash`:

```bash
alias scdrake_docker="docker exec -it -u rstudio <CONTAINER ID or NAME> scdrake"
```

Note for Docker Desktop on a Linux host: omit the `-u rstudio` (or use `-u root`).

And then use this alias as e.g.

```bash
scdrake_docker -d /home/rstudio/scdrake_projects/my_first_project --pipeline-type single_sample run
```

Notice that we are using the `-d` parameter as the alias doesn't contain the `-w` parameter which instructs Docker
to execute the command in a working directory.

Finally, you can put the alias permanently inside your `~/.bashrc` file. Just don't forget to change
`<CONTAINER ID or NAME>` when you start a new container :)

Alternatively, you can utilize the ["run and forget" way](#running-interactively-run-and-forget) described above:

```{r, include = FALSE}
out <- scdrake::format_shell_command(c(
  "alias scdrake_docker=docker run -it --rm",
  "-v $(realpath ~/scdrake_projects):/home/rstudio/scdrake_projects",
  DOCKER_IMAGE_STABLE,
  "scdrake"
))
```

`r knitr::knit(text = out)`

# Singularity

Singularity is an alternative container runner that does not require root access, so it can be used on e.g. HPCs.

You will probably use Singularity in case you don't have root permissions on the host machine.
It can be simply installed to the user space e.g. via the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
virtual environment/package manager as the [conda-forge/singularity package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/singularity).

Docker images can be simply pulled from the Docker Hub similar to `docker pull`:

`r knitr::knit(text = out_singularity_pull_stable)`

The only difference is the usage of `docker:` prefix so Singularity knows where to look for the image.
If the image is already present in the local Docker storage, you can use `docker-daemon:` instead.

After pulling, Singularity needs to convert the image to the SIF format, and that can take quite a time.
By default, the SIF file is saved in the current working directory.

## Running the image in Singularity

Here are some key differences compared to Docker:

- By default, Singularity issues commands in the container as the current user. Thus, there are no problems with file ownership.
- By default, Singularity mounts the host's user `HOME` to the container. While this might be practical in some cases,
  we rather recommend to mount an empty/different directory to `/home/<user>` in the container.
- By default, Singularity containers are read only. Thus, you can only write to mounted directories.
- Although the image also contains RStudio, unfortunately, we were not able to make it functional in Singularity.

First we will create a directory structure. These directories will be mounted to the container.
Note that we also create a fake home directory - that is because some R packages need to use a cache directory, which
is located there.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/scdrake_singularity
cd ~/scdrake_singularity
mkdir -p home/${USER} scdrake_projects/pbmc1k
```

Now we can issue a `{scdrake}` commands through its CLI:

```bash
singularity exec \
    -e \
    --no-home \
    --bind "home/${USER}/:/home/${USER},scdrake_projects/:/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects" \
    --pwd "/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects" \
    path/to/scdrake_image.sif \
    scdrake <args> <command>
```

For example, to initialize a new project:

```bash
singularity exec \
    -e \
    --no-home \
    --bind "home/${USER}/:/home/${USER},scdrake_projects/:/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects" \
    --pwd "/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects/pbmc1k" \
    path/to/scdrake_image.sif \
    scdrake --download-example-data init-project
```

And to run the pipeline using that project:

```bash
singularity exec \
    -e \
    --no-home \
    --bind "home/${USER}/:/home/${USER},scdrake_projects/:/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects" \
    --pwd "/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects/pbmc1k" \
    path/to/scdrake_image.sif \
    scdrake --pipeline-type single_sample run
```

Note that you can also start a bash or R session and use `{scdrake}` within that, e.g.

```bash
singularity exec \
    -e \
    --no-home \
    --bind "home/${USER}/:/home/${USER},scdrake_projects/:/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects" \
    --pwd "/home/${USER}/scdrake_projects/pbmc1k" \
    path/to/scdrake_image.sif \
    R
```

and then in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
scdrake::run_single_sample_r()
```

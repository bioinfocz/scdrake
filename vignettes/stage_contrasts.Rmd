***

For a general overview of this stage see `vignette("pipeline_overview")`.

Cluster markers config is stored in `contrasts.yaml` file. Location of this file is different for the
single-sample and integration pipelines. As for the [pipeline config](config_pipeline.html), directory with this file
is read from environment variables:

- `SCDRAKE_SINGLE_SAMPLE_CONFIG_DIR` for the single-sample pipeline.
- `SCDRAKE_INTEGRATION_CONFIG_DIR` for the integration pipeline.

and options named in lowercase are set upon `{scdrake}` load or attach. Then the actual directory used depends on
whether you run `run_single_sample()` / `run_single_sample_r()` or `run_integration()` / `run_integration_r()`.

# Config parameters

Parameters for this stage are almost identical to those for `cluster_markers` stage
(see `vignette("stage_cluster_markers")`). You just need to replace `CLUSTER_MARKERS` with
`CONTRASTS` in parameter names `r emoji::emoji("slightly_smiling_face")`

The different parameters are below.

***

```yaml
CONTRASTS_SOURCES:
  - dea_cluster_int_graph_louvain_r0.4:
      source_column: "cluster_int_graph_louvain_r0.4"
      description: "DEA of all groups in graph-based clustering (Louvain alg. with r = 0.4) with blocking on batch"
      contrasts: "all"
    dea_cluster_int_graph_louvain_r0.8:
     source_column: "cluster_int_graph_louvain_r0.8"
     description: "DEA of some groups in graph-based clustering (Louvain alg. with r = 0.8)"
     contrasts:
       - target: "2"
         reference: "1"
       - target: "3"
         reference: "2"
         name: "cl3_vs_cl4"
```

**Type:** list of named lists

This parameter is similar to `CLUSTER_MARKERS_SOURCES`, but an additional parameter `contrasts` is used.
It is used to specify which levels in `source_column` will be compared (differential expression).

- If `"all"`, all combinations of levels in `source_column` will be compared.
  For example, if `source_column` is `"cluster_kmeans_k3"` (k-means with `k = 3`),
  it contains three levels, and the following comparisons (contrasts) will be made:
  `1_vs_2`, `1_vs_3`, and `2_vs_3`. Note that it could lead to an excessive amount of comparisons for graph-based clustering.
- If list of lists, the following character scalar items can/must be set:
  - `target` (required): target level of `source_column`.
  - `reference` (required): reference level of `source_column`.
  - `name` (optional): unique contrast name. If not specified, will be created as `{target}_vs_{reference}`.

***

`CONTRASTS_SOURCES_DEFAULTS`

Same as `CLUSTER_MARKERS_SOURCES_DEFAULTS`, but the following parameters for statistical tests cannot be used,
and hardcoded values are used for them internally:

- `LFC_DIRECTION` (`"any"`)
- `PVAL_TYPE` (`"any"`)
- `MIN_PROP` (`null`)

# Targets

Here you can find description of the most important targets for this stage.
However, for a full overview, you have to inspect the
[source code](https://github.com/bioinfocz/scdrake/blob/main/R/plans_common.R) of the
`get_contrasts_subplan()` function.

As in the config for this stage, all target names are similar to those in the stage `cluster_markers`
after replacing `cluster_markers` with `contrasts` (with few exceptions, see below).
Please, refer to `vignette("stage_cluster_markers")`.

## `SingleCellExperiment` objects (SCE)

`sce_dimred_contrasts`, `sce_final_contrasts`, `sce_contrasts`

## Tibbles with parameters

`contrasts_params`, `contrasts_test_params`, `contrasts_heatmap_params`, `contrasts_plot_params`,
`contrasts_dimred_plot_params`

## Tibbles with cluster markers (contrasts) test results

`contrasts_raw`: a tibble, same as `cluster_markers_raw`. Used to extract results for contrasts of interest.

***

`contrasts`: a tibble with extracted results (in `markers` column) for contrasts of interest.
Contrasts are identified by columns `target`, `reference`, or `contrast_name`, and their cell grouping of origin by
`source_column`. The `name` column comes from list names in `CONTRASTS_SOURCES`.

`contrasts_out`: same as `contrasts`, but `markers` are coerced to dataframes and column names are normalized to snake_case.

`contrasts_for_tables`: same as `contrasts_out`, but `markers` dataframes are prepared for HTML output.
See `cluster_markers_for_tables` in `vignette("cluster_markers")`.

## Heatmaps

`seu_for_contrasts_heatmaps`, `contrasts_heatmaps_df`

## Marker plots

`contrasts_plots_top`

## Dimensionality reduction plots

`contrasts_dimred_plots`

## Other targets

`config_contrasts`: a list holding parameters for this stage.

Description:
    This pipeline is implemented in the drake Make-like toolkit (https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and
    provides the following steps of scRNA-seq and spot-based SRT secondary analysis: input quality control, filtering of spots/cells/genes,
    normalization, clustering, cell type annotation, spot deconvolution cluster markers, differential expression analysis
    (constrasts -> cluster vs. cluster), integration of multiple samples.
    All main parts are accompanied by rich graphical outputs and HTML reports
    (RMarkdown). Thanks to the drake package, the pipeline is highly reproducible, scalable and efficient, provides easy
    access to all intermediate results, and can be arbitrarily extended as pipeline definitions are abstracted as
    R objects. A command line interface is available to perform the most important actions directly in shell terminal.
